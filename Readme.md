1.	Initialize Moralis and find a smart contract.
2.	Create an HTML index file.
3.	Make a login function.
4.	Create an upload function.
5.	Build your mint function.

By following these five steps, we can create a dApp to mint our own NFTs on command. The users need to authenticate themselves with MetaMask and input a name, description, and file. Once theyâ€™re done, all that remains is to upload and mint the NFT, which then can be viewed on OpenSea.
